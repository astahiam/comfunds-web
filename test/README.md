## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Not Running**
   ```
   Error: Connection refused
   Solution: Start Go backend on port 8080
   ```

   ```
   Error: Connection refused
   Solution: Start Flutter web app on port 3000
   ```

3. **Authentication Failures**
   ```
   Error: 401 Unauthorized
   Solution: Check test user credentials
   ```

4. **Database Connection Issues**

   Error: Database connection failed
   Solution: Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   ```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests with debug output
flutter test --verbose --reporter=expanded

# Run specific test with debug
flutter test test/integration/api_integration_test.dart --verbose
```
